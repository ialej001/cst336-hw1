        	Created by Sun Microsystems in the early 90s, Java was originally designed for digital devices. 
        	Its focus was shifted upon release, with V1.0 being orientated towards internet applications.
        	Over the years, it has evolved and grown into a robust programming language that can be used on 
        	a wide range of devices on and off the internet. <br>
        	Java is an object orientated programming language that is easy to use, reliable, and secure. Its
        	 compiled applications can be ran on any digital machine that has the Java Runtime Environment installed.
