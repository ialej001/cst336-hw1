        	C++ gets its name from its creator, Bjarne Stroustrup. The operator '++' is in C and means to increment 
        	a number by 1. C++ was meant to be a successor to C and its major improvement upon C was the addition of 
        	classes and transition C into an object orientated language. Other improvements made were the addition of
        	inheritance, default function arguments, and strong type checking. C++ is still being maintained and developed. 
        	It's newest update was in 2011 with C++11.</div>
